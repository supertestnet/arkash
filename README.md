# Arkash
Using Ark as a backend to recreate the experience of ecash, but self-custodial (and not as private)

# What is this?
This is a step closer to a self-custodial ecash-like experience. I've been working on something similar for a while with my Hedgehog project, but a few nights ago I realized that Ark can do the same thing: store a lightning payment with a third party non-custodial (Ark servers and Hedgehog servers are both non-custodial), such that anyone who knows a certain private key can use it to withdraw that money, and then share the private key with your recipient. Voila! It's asynchronous. They don't need to be online when you create the payment, and you don't need to be online when they redeem it.

# How can I try it?

But be warned: it is only for testing, and you are likely to lose your money. Only put money in if you are willing to lose it for the sake of science.
